# Hello World!! Yash this side.

A passionate data science professional currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on Data Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, I bring a unique blend of academic excellence and industry experience to the field. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, including machine learning, applied machine learning, and deep learning. Recently, I've expanded my skill set to include Docker, enhancing my ability to create and deploy scalable data science solutions.

With over three years of experience as an Associate Consultant at KPMG, I've had the opportunity to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. My work has involved implementing advanced natural language processing models, such as DistillBERT for article classification and LSTM for topic modeling, significantly improving efficiency and reducing project execution times. I've also contributed to developing go-to-market products and strategy documents, demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between technical expertise and business acumen. My diverse skill set, which includes proficiency in Python, SQL, R, and various data visualization tools, positions me well to tackle complex data-driven problems and deliver impactful solutions in the ever-evolving field of data science
